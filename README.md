Here you can find Bitcloud logos, wallpapers and another media content. I'm still working on this Repository, but I need your help to improve this content. Any content you find, please submit by an issue or by a pull request - it doesn't matter if you think we already have this image, just send anyways. 

Designers and Artists
----
If you are designer and created some Bitcloud arts, please send us your art, no matter the quality. If it is about Bitcloud, send it to us. Also, we ask for designers create wallpapers, logos and arts about Bitcloud, this is extremely important. If you create anything, send it to us. 

Requests
-----
At the moment I can't provide any media content, but you already can request it at [Issues](https://github.com/wetube/media/issues). As soon I can, I will get the Bitcloud designers and put them here, so they'll be available to help all Teams, not just Web Team.
